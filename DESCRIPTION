Description: Matching sequences of unknown origin to known anti-Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis potential
    Matching by percent identity of 16S rRNA sequences of variable regions (e.g. V4, V5, etc.) from different organisms.
    Adapted from the Woodhams et al. (2015) database of known anti-Bd microbial strains for use of hypothesis generation of anti-Bd potential using sequence composition
